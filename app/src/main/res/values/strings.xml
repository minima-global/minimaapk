    <string name="minima_backup">
        Making a backup of your Minima node is VERY important.\n
        \n
        On Minima you are the only one who looks after your coins.\n
        \n
        Currently - backups are only valid for 1-2 months.\n
        \n
        The files are about 500Kb.. so not very big.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_restore">
        You can easily restore from a backup.\n
        \n
        Once you have restored Minima will shutdown.\n
        \n
        When finished - please re-open Minima and your data will have been restored.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive">
        You can also resync from an Archive Node - but this should be as a LAST resort\n
        \n
        You can reset your chain to the latest tip or you can reset your NEW device to an old wallet\n
        \n
        When finished - please re-open Minima and your data will have been restored.

        Do NOT copy / paste your seed phrase here!\n
        \n
        The clipboard is insecure\n
        \n
        Either leave blank for a simple tip resync - if you are on the wrong chain - OR type each word individually and let the suggestions help you to reset your whole wallet..
