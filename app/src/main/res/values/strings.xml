Welcome to Minima\n
\n
The complete blockchain solution\n
\n
You now have access to a decentralised value and information transfer network unlike anything you have seen before\n
\n
An open application ecosystem known as the MDS - MiniDAPP System - allows you to interface easily with this new paradigm\n
\n
Value, Information and Application - everything you need to do anything you want\n
\n
We are still working hard to fit all the pieces together but we hope you enjoy this taste of Freedom\n

    <string name="minima_backup">
        Making a backup of your Minima node is VERY important.\n
        \n
        On Minima you are the only one who looks after your coins.\n
        \n
        Currently - backups are only valid for 1-2 months.\n
        \n
        The files are about 1MB.. so not very big.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_restore">
        You can easily restore from a backup.\n
        \n
        Once you have restored Minima will shutdown.\n
        \n
        When finished - please re-open Minima and your data will have been restored.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive">
        You can also resync from an Archive Node - but this should be as a LAST resort\n
        \n
        You can reset your chain to the latest tip or you can reset your NEW device to an old wallet\n
        \n
        When finished - please re-open Minima and your data will have been restored.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive_explain">
        Do NOT copy / paste your seed phrase here!\n
        \n
        The clipboard is insecure\n
        \n
        Either leave blank for a simple tip resync - if you are on the wrong chain - OR type each word individually and let the suggestions help you to reset your whole wallet..
    </string>

    <string name="minima_vaultlock">
        Encrypt your private keys with a password.\n
        \n
        You will not be able to send any coins or sign anything.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_vaultunlock">
        Decrypt your private keys with your password.\n
        \n
        You will be able to send coins and sign again.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive_chainsync">
        You can re-sync JUST the Minima blockchain.\n
        \n
        This will leave your wallet and keys untouched.\n
        \n
        You can do this if you find yourself on the wrong chain.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive_chainsync_text">
        Here you can choose the Archive node host:port you will be connecting to.\n
        \n
        The default is \'auto\' - where we pick one for you.\n
        \n
        Once you have started please wait for the process to finish - then Minima will shutdown.\n
        \n
        Restart Minima and the changes will have taken effect.\n
        \n
        Your wallet and private keys will remain unchanged.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_archive_seedsync">
        As a last resort you can re-sync your entire wallet.\n
        \n
        If you lose your phone, and do not have a backup you can use JUST your seed phrase to do a complete Wallet re-sync.\n
        \n
        Your wallet and keys will be reset to the chosen seed phrase and all blocks re-downloaded.
    </string>

    <string name="params_dialog_text">
        Here you can set extra startup params for Minima.\n
        \n
        Do NOT touch this unless you are sure you know what you are doing.\n
        \n
        -archive : Run an archive node on your phone\n
        -mdspassword : Specify your mds password\n
        -rpcenable : enable RPC (use with SSL)\n
        ..\n
        \n
        You will need to restart Minima for changes to take effect.
