    <string name="minima_backup">
        Making a backup of your Minima node is VERY important.\n
        \n
        On Minima you are the only one who looks after your coins.\n
        \n
        Currently - backups are only valid for 1-2 months.\n
        \n
        The files are about 500Kb.. so not very big.
    </string>

    <string name="minima_restore">
        You can easily restore from a backup.\n
        \n
        Once you have restored Minima will shutdown.\n
        \n
        Please re-open Minima and your data will have been restored.
